Hi everyone, I’m a senior blockchain and smart contract engineer.
I’ve been working in Web3 for years, building on Ethereum, Cardano, Solana, Cosmos, and L2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, StarkNet, and zkSync.

My background covers zk-rollups and zero-knowledge proofs for scaling and privacy, cross-chain interoperability, tokenization of real-world assets, and account abstraction to make wallets more user friendly. I also work with AI + blockchain — things like AI-driven oracles, smart automation, and predictive DeFi systems.

On the security side, I’ve done formal verification, fuzz testing, and smart contract audits, and I’m very focused on safe governance models. I’ve delivered DeFi protocols handling over $100M TVL, NFT and cross-chain platforms processing millions of transactions, and helped design DAO governance with advanced voting and compliance.

I enjoy talking about zk tech, L2 scaling, AI-enhanced DeFi, RWA tokenization, DAO governance, and security-first smart contracts. Always open to exchanging ideas and collaborating.
